# Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard analyzes customer churn behavior in a banking institution. Using customer data such as age, geography, credit score, account activity, and product usage, the project aims to identify key patterns behind customer exits. The dashboard is divided into three pages: (1) overall churn analysis and key risk indicators, (2) customer segmentation and behavioral insights, and (3) churn prevention strategies with actionable recommendations. Through interactive visuals and DAX-driven insights, this project helps uncover who is likely to churn, why they leave, and how the bank can improve retention efforts.
